## Getting Started

 - Make sure you have Jupyter Notebooks in your computer or in an online space.
 - Make sure the computer has a GPU for training the models both locally via graphic cards such as NVIDIA or online spaces such as  Google Colab

## Installing

Just open the notebooks in your gpu space of choice such as [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/), [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true), [PaperSpace](https://www.paperspace.com/) or any other workspace of your choice including a local setup!



## Built With
These are implemented with either  or  libraries
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - The python framework used
* [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) - This is also a python framework built on top of Pytorch
